      A first-generation immigrant, I moved to the United States at thirteen. Having grown up as a
      boarding school kid, I was no stranger to living in different Indian cities and meeting new people.
      It was the move across the Atlantic, however, that brought me many new challenges and a new home.
      Beautiful Boston perplexed me with its love for the Red Sox, chowder, and unrolled R's. But it also
      welcomed me with open arms and before I knew it, I was spending all my weekends at Mike's Pastry.

  <a id = "about1" class = "head-tags" href = "about.html#about1"> Background</a>
    <p class = "front2">
      Until I had to think about choosing a major at Cornell, I had
      little clarity on how I could bridge my seemingly disjoint interests and inclinations.
      On one hand, I loved mathematics and programming. I found solace in the methodical and highly
      applied nature of the subjects, and especially enjoyed seeing my code shape up into meaningful
      projects in classes. On the other hand, I also found myself exploring the occassional business
      class. Outside the classroom, student government and business-oriented roles in campus organizations
      always caught my interest.
    </p>

    <p class = "front2"> By junior year, I was declared as an Information Science major and became a web-developer on the
      Cornell Rocketry Team, the President of the Cornell Student Union Board, and the Sponsorship Lead on
      Cornell Big Red//Hacks. It was during this year that I began to groom my thoughts on my career ambitions.
      I became especially interested in how my technical foundation could help me facilitate and even manage
      the business (development, creation, testing, marketing) of a certain product. Bringing together my
      love for technology and software with my inclination for leadership and business, I happened upon the
      roles and responsibilities of a product manager.
    </p>

    <p class = "front2"> I haven't looked back since! It is my dream to become a product manager and eventually pursue
      an MBA.

    <a id = "about2" class = "head-tags" href = "about.html#about2"> Education</a>
      <p class = "front2">
        An Information Science major, I am concentrating in Data Science and minoring in Business at Cornell
        University. A blend between programming, computer science, data science, web-development, business,
        and humanities, my Cornell education has opened my eyes to the boundless world of technology and products
        in technology. Information Science majors are encouraged to evaluate their technical projects with their
        users in mind. This can be eespecially challenging for an engineer whose technical knowledge is often far
        more refined than his or her target users' knowledge. This creates a gap between the intended use and
        actual use of a design and often stops users from utilizing a product completely. Through projects that
        allow us to dissect common societal problems using our technical skills, Cornell's Information Science
        education has helped me piece together a comprehensive look at technology and digital products.

    <a id = "about3" class = "head-tags" href = "about.html#about3"> Goals & Ambitions</a>
        <p class = "front2">

          Product Managers are leaders in control of their ideas. Such a role is not only empowering,
          but in the context of the tech industry, can allow one to have a deep impact on lives. It
          is through products and services that technology has transformed the trajectory of human
          civilization. The power of one product can never be underestimated.

          As a product manager or leader in technology, I hope to exemplify user-centered innovation
          and deliver a seamless user experience through my product.
