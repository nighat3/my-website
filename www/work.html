  As a college student still determining her path, I prize learning opportunities outside the classroom
  that help me formulate and understand my career goals.
  Through internships and on-campus involvement, I have the opportunity to practically apply classroom
  concepts to impactful projects and learn how the industry utilizies my talents. Having worked in
  large-scale companies as well as student-run organizations, I have sharpened a variety of skills in
  computer science, programming, web-development, data science, product management, business, and tech
  leadership.

    <p id = "Thermo" class = "amex-paragraph">
      As an IT Leadership intern for Thermo Fisher Scientific this summer, I expanded
      upon many software, data analytics, and leadership skills. After my first month
      at the company, I discovered an opportunity for Thermo Fisher to improve communication
      amongst employees across the company's many sites. The IT Team was being overloaded
      with Service Now requests while employees had to wait weeks before someone from IT
      could help them.
      <p class = "amex-paragraph">
        I designed and implemented a web-application in the Office 365
      environment that allows employees to better leverage the diverse skill sets that exist
      within the company when they run into common issues. When employees have issues with
      using a certain software, their devices, or need consultation on specific areas of
      expertise (project management, for example), they can look employees up by name,
      location, or skill in this application. Once they find an employee they want to
      reach out, the applications connects the two and documents the requests employees
      needed assistance with. I am working to modify and polish this application to integrate
      PostgreSQL and Python to more efficiently document, access, and store large data. This
      application can help the company figure out how to move internal processes faster and
      pinpoint where common difficulties occur. The Director of IT would like me to continue
      building this application so that Thermo Fisher IT can implement it in the future.
    </p>
    <p class = "amex-paragraph">
      In addition to this independent project, I co-led the IT Standard Processes Project with
      my manager. This project focused on restructuring processes within IT through
      standardization and aimed to better serve customers through a more unified internal approach.
      Collaborating with IT managers across Thermo Fisher's sites, I defined what data to collect to
      identify what to standardize. I then manipulated, extracted, and transformed the data using
      tools like PowerBI, SQL databases and SharpCloud to present the cleaned data in regular meetings.

      As a software Intern with the Risk Management Team, my primary role was to work
      with the MIT Safari Project, a situational-awareness program written by MIT PhD
      candidates in Python. I learned how to work within an Ubuntu environment of a
      Linux PC and how to use Guake Terminal to launch the program and its many servers.
      Although a valuable tool, the project was out of use due to errors in code and
      changing/misplacing of file locations and folders and my task was to get it running
      again as the candidates who wrote it were no longer at MIT. Over three months, I
      used the debugging console and expanded my knowledge of Python by trying to fix the
      several components of the project. I made use of Python documentation to address errors
      I had little knowledge of and wrote a guide that office members with little to no
      coding experience could use to launch the program and its servers.

      In addition to this project, I also completed an independent project in which I
      implemented a K-means clustering tool for enhanced data analytics and presented it
      to upper management. I integrated it with Tableau, a visualization tool, to simplify
      k-means clustering for those I was presenting to and showed them how they could extend
      the functionality of simple tools by embedding code in them.

      As President of the Cornell Student Union Board, I head Cornell's on-campus Student Union. I am working to re-brand the organization to have improved retention, a well-managed budget, and increased campus presence. In this role, I have gained experience in leading a group of students and maintaining business partnerships with other organizations regularly. Working with the Cornell Student Assembly, I devise and use a budget of nearly $60,000 annually to promote student interests through events. In addition, I help finance campus groups and market numerous events with them during the semester. We also partner with the Cornell Administration to help raise awareness about common student-life concerns such as mental-health, AIDS-awareness, and voting in elections. This position teaches me the importance of taking initiatives and understanding how to use leverage different skills within a team to achieve an end result. It is indeed a very significant role to me as it will help me leave a positive legacy on the campus and student body that surround me.
