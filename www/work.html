  As a college student still determining her path, I draw career inspiration from the
  work and projects I partake in outside the classroom. Gone are the days when interns
  brought superiors coffee and made them copies. From my very first summer internship to
  my final one, I have been given the same work environment and (perhaps more) resources
  as full-time employees to thrive at a company and understand how the industry
  utilizes my talents. Every summer brings with it new challenges, but also a chance to
  develop new skills and hone older ones.

</p>

<p class = "work-paragraph">
  During every semester, I strive to be involved in at least three organizations
  that each offer me something unique. This semester, I was President of the Cornell Student
  Union Board, a web-developer on the Cornell Rocketry Project Team, and the Sponsorship Lead
  on Cornell Big Red//Hacks, a student-run hackathon. Whether I am developing myself as a leader,
  a businesswoman or a programmer, my involvement outside the classroom helps me connect my personal
  interests to my professional goals.

  As an IT Leadership intern for Thermo Fisher Scientific this summer, I expanded
  upon many software, data analytics, and leadership skills. After my first month
  at the company, I discovered an opportunity for Thermo Fisher to improve communication
      amongst employees across the company's many sites. The IT Team was being overloaded
      with Service Now requests while employees had to wait weeks before someone from IT
      could help them.

  I designed and implemented a web-application in the Office 365
        environment that allows employees to better leverage the diverse skill sets that exist
        within the company when they run into common issues. When employees have issues with
        using a certain software, their devices, or need consultation on specific areas of
        expertise (project management, for example), they can look employees up by name,
        location, or skill in this application. Once they find an employee they want to
        reach out, the applications connects the two and documents the requests employees
        needed assistance with. I am working to modify and polish this application to integrate
        PostgreSQL and Python to more efficiently document, access, and store large data. This
        application can help the company figure out how to move internal processes faster and
        pinpoint where common difficulties occur. The Director of IT would like me to continue
        building this application so that Thermo Fisher IT can implement it in the future.

  In addition to this independent project, I co-led the IT Standard Processes Project with
      my manager. This project focused on restructuring processes within IT through
      standardization and aimed to better serve customers through a more unified internal approach.
      Collaborating with IT managers across Thermo Fisher's sites, I defined what data to collect to
      identify what to standardize. I then manipulated, extracted, and transformed the data using
      tools like PowerBI, SQL databases and SharpCloud to present the cleaned data in regular meetings.

  As a software Intern with the Risk Management Team, my primary role was to work
with the MIT Safari Project, a situational-awareness program written by MIT PhD
candidates in Python. I learned how to work within an Ubuntu environment of a
Linux PC and how to use Guake Terminal to launch the program and its many servers.
Although a valuable tool, the project was out of use due to errors in code and
changing/misplacing of file locations and folders and my task was to get it running
again as the candidates who wrote it were no longer at MIT.

  Over three months, I
  used the debugging console and expanded my knowledge of Python by trying to fix the
  several components of the project. I made use of Python documentation to address errors
  I had little knowledge of and wrote a guide that office members with little to no
  coding experience could use to launch the program and its servers.</p>

<p class = "hidden comp-para2">
  In addition to this project, I also completed an independent project in which I
      implemented a K-means clustering tool for enhanced data analytics and presented it
      to upper management. I integrated it with Tableau, a visualization tool, to simplify
      k-means clustering for those I was presenting to and showed them how they could extend
      the functionality of simple tools by embedding code in them.

  As a web-developer for the Cornell Rocketry Project Team, I help design and maintain the Cornell Rocketry Team website using HTML, CSS, PHP, Hostgator, XAMP, and Github. In addition to the website, my team and I design internal web tools for the Team Leadership to store data such as documentation and important information for future team members. Currently, we are working on creating a tool that allows the Team Leads to record all new applicants' applications, interviews, and preferences for what projects they want to work on.

  This semester, I am working on structuring and hosting the Team Website using a node.js framework. The current
  website relies primarily HTML and CSS, and internal tools rely on PHP. I hope to teach myself how to leverage
  node.js and other frameworks such as vue.js and express.js to create faster and more "light-weight"
  website and internal tools.

    As President of the Cornell Student Union Board, I head Cornell's on-campus Student Union. I am working to re-brand the organization to have improved retention, a well-managed budget, and increased campus presence. In this role, I have gained experience in leading a group of students and maintaining business partnerships with other organizations regularly. Working with the Cornell Student Assembly, I devise and use a budget of nearly $60,000 annually to promote student interests through events.
</p>

<p class = "hidden sub-para">
  I help finance campus groups and market numerous events with them during the semester. We also partner with the Cornell Administration to help raise awareness about common student-life concerns such as mental-health, AIDS-awareness, and voting in elections. This position teaches me the importance of taking initiatives and understanding how to use leverage different skills within a team to achieve an end result. It is indeed a very significant role to me as it will help me leave a positive legacy on the campus and student body that surround me.

Although not directly relevant to my technical major, being one of SUB's most successful recent
presidents has been crucial to shaping how I think as a person. I learned how to balance diplomacy
with being opinionated, authoritativeness with being friendly, and ambition with being a realist.
Perhaps most importantly, I learned how to pioneer <em> change </em> and make it a reality despite
facing obstacles and constraints at every step.
